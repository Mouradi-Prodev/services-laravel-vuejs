Here are some things you need to consider when implementing this feature:

Validation: You should validate the uploaded file to ensure that it's a valid zip file and contains the necessary files, such as the index.html, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Security: Make sure to implement proper security measures to prevent any potential security risks, such as malicious code or file overwrite. You can use a library like PHP ZipArchive or other server-side technologies to extract the uploaded zip file and store the files securely.

User interface: You need to provide a user interface that allows the user to upload their zip file and also displays any errors or success messages.

Storage: You need to store the extracted files in a secure location, such as a dedicated folder in your server or a cloud storage service.
